# Multi-class-Classification-and-Neural-Networks-using-MatLab

It is Programming Exercise 3 for Machine Learning Classe (Stanford)

https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/home/welcome

In this exercise I implemented "one-vs-all logistic regression and neural networks to recognize hand-written digits."

Files that were provided by  Andrew Ng who tought this class:

ex3.m 

ex3 nn.m 

ex3data1.mat - Training set of hand-written digits

ex3weights.mat - Initial weights for the neural network exercise

submit.m 

displayData.m - Function to help visualize the dataset

fmincg.m - Function minimization routine (similar to fminunc) sigmoid.m - Sigmoid function

I wrote:

lrCostFunction.m - Logistic regression cost function

oneVsAll.m - Train a one-vs-all multi-class classifier

predictOneVsAll.m - Predict using a one-vs-all multi-class classifier

predict.m - Neural network prediction function
